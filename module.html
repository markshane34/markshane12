<h3>Module 6: ETHICAL AND LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS.</h3>
This module aims to
deepen your understanding about ethical and legal issues in the light of
applications development and emerging technologies. SpecificThis course has the following modules based on the prototype syllabus given in
CMO 25, s. 2015.
<h3>Module 1: OVERVIEW OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES.</h3>
This module aims to
introduce to you the concept of applications development and emerging
technologies, how they developed and how it is differentiated with existing and
developing technologies. It also covers the potential applications of these ET
along education, business, health and society. Moreover, Industry 4.0 and
smart factory are likewise introduced in this module.
